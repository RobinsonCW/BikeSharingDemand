# Introduction

[Intro]


# Data Description

The dataset we chose for this project was a publicly shared, hourly bike sharing dataset made available through Kaggle in csv format. 

This data set is divided into two distinct sets â€“ a train and test set. The train set consists of 10,886 rows (titled "train.csv") and the test set consists of 6,493 rows (titled "test.csv"). Within the training set, the first 19 days of each month are captured whereas in the test data set, the 20th day to the end of each month is present. The entirity of the data spans from 1/1/2011 through 12/31/2012 - encompassing two full years of bike sharing data. Interstingly, the time component of this analysis is captured in hours of each day meaning we have a calendar date represented 24 times (for each hour of that day) in the data, along with it's associated attribute values.

In train data set, there are a total of 12 attributes which capture multiple variables related to bike rentals. Some of these attributes are categorical, and others are continuous. All attributes are summarized in the table below:

  Column Name      |Type                  |Description
  -----------------|--------------------- |------------------------------------------------
  1.  datetime     |    Date			        |YYYY-MM-DD HH24 (example:  2011-01-01 04:00:00)
  2.  season       |    Integer 		      |(1-4)
  3.  holiday      |    Integer 		      |(0 or 1)
  4.  workingday   |    Integer 		      |(0 or 1)
  5.  weather      |    Integer 		      |(1-4)
  6.  temp         |    Float 			      |temparture in Celcius
  7.  atemp        |    Float 			      |"feels like" temperature in Celsius
  8.  humidity     |    Integer           |relative humidity
  9.  windspeed    |    Float             |wind speed
  10. casual       |    Integer 		      |count of casual users 
  11. registered   |    Integer 		      |count of registered users 
  12. count        |    Integer 		      |count of total users `response variable`
  

** The test data set lacks the casual, registered and count variables.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Plotting Explanatory vs. Response Variables

### Categorical Variables

Several numeric variables were found to be better suited to categorization and were converted to factors.

* Season
* Holiday
* Working Day
* Weather

Season           |Label                 |Description
-----------------|--------------------- |------------------------------------------------
1                | Spring               | Dec 21 ~ Mar 20
2                | Summer               | Mar 21 ~ Jun 20
3                | Fall                 | Jun 21 ~ Sep 20
4                | Winter               | Sep 21 ~ Dec 20

The datetime column was broken out into multiple factors as well so that we could visualize the components of each date and aggregate by different dimensions of the timestamp.  We felt this was also necessary due to the nature of how the train/ test data sets had been pre-split.  (i.e...with the first 19 days of the month holding the only true counts to validate our models against.)

* Year
* Month
* Day
* Hour

### Continuous Variables

* Count by Temperature

* Count by "Feels like" Temperature

* Count by Wind Speed


### Correlation Matrix

There are several variables with a relatively high level of covariance.  The following columns should therefore be removed so as not to be picked up by any automated techniques. 

* atemp
* causual 
* registered
